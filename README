Welcome to Mojo Mobile.

Mojo Mobile is built on top of the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project

To get started with a project look in Resources/app.js

The Mojo-esque abstraction logic of this project can be found in Resources/mojo/kernel.js

The current state of affairs of abstraction is: SiteMap -> Controller -> Voila

Soon to be: SiteMap -> Controller + Model + View -> Voila

There is a huge need right now to further abstract the logic in the kernel to provide more diverse work flows like table view.

Currently the kernel in it's proof of concept state only supports tabbed view, but does so well on both iOS and Android.

If you want to help make this project better, please get in touch.
